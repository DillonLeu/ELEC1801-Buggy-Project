# ELEC1801 Buggy Group Project (Year 1)

The BTLE RN4871 device is used to establish a connection between master/slave device via bluetooth:

The master module attached to a breadboard with momentary switches act as a remote control device or transmitter, and the slave module attached to the buggy acts as a receiver which will turn on certain gates of the MOSFETs within the H - Bridges.

In this schematic diagram, two H - Bridges are assembled to generate forward, backward, and swiveling motion of the buggy :

Each H - Bridge is used to power one side of the buggy's wheels.
